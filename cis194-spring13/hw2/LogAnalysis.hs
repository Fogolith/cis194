For example, to convert a String like "562" into an Int, you
can use the read function. Other functions which may (or may not)
be useful to you include lines, words, unwords, take, drop, and (.)

  lines :: String -> [String] Source

  lines breaks a string up into a list of strings at newline characters. The resulting strings do not contain newlines.

  words :: String -> [String] Source

  words breaks a string up into a list of words, which were delimited by white space.

  unlines :: [String] -> String Source

  unlines is an inverse operation to lines. It joins lines, after appending a terminating newline to each.

  unwords :: [String] -> String Source

  unwords is an inverse operation to words. It joins words with separating spaces.

  take :: Int -> [a] -> [a] Source

  take n, applied to a list xs, returns the prefix of xs of length n, or xs itself if n > length xs:

  drop :: Int -> [a] -> [a] Source

  drop n xs returns the suffix of xs after the first n elements, or [] if n > length xs:

of a LogMessage in any Node should be greater than all timestamps
of any LogMessage in the left subtree, and less than all timestamps
of any LogMessage in the right child.

sort the well-formed messages using an expression such as:
